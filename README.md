# Discord installer for RPM based systems

## Why not install via Flatpak?
In my case, I try to use Discord Rich Presence extension on Visual Studio Code and needs modifications in order to support IPC. I'm Lazy... zZzZZ*zzz*...

If you prefer Flatpak, go ahead: https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.discordapp.Discord

## How to install
1. Download the tar.gz file on https://discord.com/download and save on any directory in your user directory;
